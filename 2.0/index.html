These were created by combining Excel and manual report analysis, after which the content was copied and pasted into PowerPoint for distribution. While some recipients would have the results printed for them, others would view them on a laptop.<br><br>It would take roughly two days to produce each pack, allowing for the inclusion of pertinent commentary and meeting the strict month-end closure deadlines.<br><br>The Ministry's SAP ERP systems would serve as the primary source of the necessary data.<br><br>I used Web Intelligence (a component of SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise) to come up with a solution that would reuse the rules that were already hidden in the Excel workbooks to generate the report content automatically. Additionally, the necessary commentary was typed straight into the report, and the finished product was exported to PDF format for sharing.<br><br>Each report pack would then be updated, examined, verified, and finished in a few hours, not including waiting for the commentary.<br><br>Naturally, a great deal of time was saved, and the recipients were not aware of the modifications. This began the strategic shift to improve the Ministry's capacity and response time to all requests by combining data modelling with reporting and analysis.<br><br>In subsequent work, I assisted with the analytics strategy, which included using cloud SaaS apps and adhering to data governance and sovereignty regulations set forth by the UK government.</p>
